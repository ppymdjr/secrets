#+TITLE: Secrets README

* Introduction
  This is a directory containing secrets. Encrypted of course. 

 To make emacs play nice with encryption I added the following in
 file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf 

 ~pinentry-mode loopback~
  
I also added this to my emacs: ~(setq
epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)~

Also note the header line. Now I have GPG symmetrically encrypted
things with strong passphrases and emacs epa knows how to open
them. Cool.
